NOTES:
1.You should add in at least 1/2 cup of mix-ins but no more than 1 cup of mix-ins.

2.If you're looking for a nut-free alternative, you can try making a paste with dates. Check out my energy bars recipe to learn more.

3.If you prefer sweeter bars, you can add a few more tablespoons of honey. I recommend making the recipe as is, and after you've combined all the ingredients, you can taste and stir in more honey if needed.

4.Make sure to use creamy natural nut butter, the kind that is drippy and needs to be stirred. If you use regular nut butter, you will need to melt it first as it will be too thick to stir in your oats.

5.The bars hold together better with rolled oats. However, if you don't like eating oats that haven't been softened, you can use quick oats. Quick oats will become soft when soaked in the nut butter mixture. The tradeoff is that the quick oat bars don't hold together as well.
