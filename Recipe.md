INSTRUCTIONS:
1.Line the bottom of an 8 inch by 8 inch (can also use a 9 x 9) baking pan with parchment paper.

2.Add almond butter and honey into a large bowl. Stir until the two ingredients are evenly mixed together.

3.Add in rolled oats. Stir until evenly combined and all oats are coated in almond butter mixture. Add in chocolate chips and stir until evenly combined.

4.Spread evenly into prepared pan. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the surface and press down to compact the granola. 

5.Place something on top of the bars to apply light pressure (I used another 8 x 8 pan). 

6.Place bars into freezer to set (at least 1 hour). 

7.Cut into bars with a sharp knife. 

8.Let bars soften a few minutes at room temperature before eating. Store uneaten bars in fridge or freezer.
